# Key-Level-Indicator
When using TradingView, if you add this script to the indicators section, it will automatically mark important key (institutional) levels (Daily Open, Weekly Open, Monday's Range etc.) for you. 
In the settings tab you can change the physical appearance of the desired level lines, such as color and thickness, and turn them on and off.
